#Lippia Web sample project 

##System Requirements :
+ git client: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git
+ docker 18.09: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
+ docker compose 1.24: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

##Purpose
This project has the intention of show in a practical way how to use Lippia Automation Framework to build automated tests using Gherkin and Page-Object pattern. This sample project includes the required components as binaries, docker containers and configuration files to simply download and run a set of sample tests in your local computer, using the Lippia container stack described bellow.

#Getting started

##Executing tests in you local machine
- go to root project folder and you will find a pom.xml file
- run the following command : 
```
mvn clean test
```

##Executing tests in you local machine with Docker


###Starting Docker stack with Linux

After downloading the project from repository you can see the following files into your local folder

- To start the containers, simply run the following command : 
```
    sudo docker-compose up --scale chrome=10 -d
```

This command, will start download the images needed to build all the containers and start them. It takes a while to download the images depending on your internet connection. After that you you can check the containers are up and running executing the following command `docker containers ls `. 
You have to see 10 Chrome Browsers, 1 Selenium Grid and 1 Jenkins.

```



###Starting Docker stack with Windows
If you use Microsoft Windows, open a console (remember to chose **Run as administrator**) 

- go to root project directory
- run the following command wait to virtualbox instance start, this operation will be take several minutes. This will provision the Docker containers inside a Virtual Box managed by Vagrant.
`vagrant up --provision `

*pegar imagen de consola de Windows con Vagrant*

- to end vagrant execute 
`vagrant halt`

###Check Docker stack is up and running
After starting the stack you can see  and selenium grid following url:
Jenkins: http://localhost:8080

*Pegar imagen del jenkins*

Selenium Grid: http://localhost:4444/grid/console

*Pegar imagen del grid condsole*


###Run from console with Selenium Grid 
- run the following command 
`mvn clean -P GridParallel test`

*Pegar imagen de consola*

Also you can find the Extent report generated by Lippia in 
###Run from Jenkins with Selenium Grid 

Enter Jenkins console http://localhost:8080 with the following credentials
Username: **admin**
Password: **secret**

*Pegar imagen del job del jenkins*

###Docker stack

The following project includes the basic Docker Lippia Containers to run this  web sample project. You can choose to run the code from your favourite IDE, run from console or from Jenkins using the Docker Stack.
To install and start a local instalation with Docker containers following the ![Lippia Docker Web Readme] https://bitbucket.org/crowdarautomation/lippia-web-example-project/src/lippia_docker_web_readme.md

##Project structure

A typical Lippia Test Automation project usually looks like this 

```

        └── features
            └── Inicio.feature
```

Folder's description:

|Path   |Description    |
|-------|----------------|
|main\java\\...\examples\pages\\\*.java|Folder with all the **PageObjects** matching steps with java code|
|main\java\\...\examples\steps\\\*Steps.java|Folder with all the **steps** wich match with Gherkin Test Scenarios |
|test\resources\features\\\*.feature|Folder with all the **feature files** containing **Test Scenarios** and **Sample Data** |
|main\resources|Folder with all configuration needed to run Lippia |

In this example, *Inicio* is the first web page the framework will interact with. The **steps** defined in *InicioSteps.java* to execute the *Test Scenarios* defined in Gherkin language. 


|File   | Description    |
|-------|----------------|
|Inicio.java   | PageObject: between each element in the webpage *Inicio* you want to interact with. You need to add one new file for each page you want to navigate in your tests. |
|InicioSteps.java   | StepOpject: Code to support the behaviour of each **step** coded into the feature files for the *Inicio* web page. This code executes the interaction between the Framework and the web application and match the steps with the code who run interactions. |
|Inicio.feature| Feature file: Definition of the **Test Scenarios** with all the **steps** written in Cucumber format (http)|


###Page Object

Descripcion de la clase page object

```
   public Inicio(SharedDriver driver){
        super(driver);
        this.url = "";
    }

    public void navegarAlInicio(){
        navigateToIt();
    }
```

###Step Opject


###Feature File

The Test Scenarios can be written using BDD metodology. This project includes Cucumber as BDD interpreter which is supported by Lippia by default. On each declared step you can insert the calls defined from service classes

### Reports 

By default Lippia expose Test results using Extent Report Community Edition (https://github.com/extent-framework)
In order to see test results this project includes extent report that show you the result of each run. This kind of reporting is really easy to understand. 
You just need to open it and navigate for all the report page to earn the much information as you can for every run.
